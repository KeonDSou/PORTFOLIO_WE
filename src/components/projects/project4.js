        <p className="span-white">My final project at General Assembly was to create a full MERN stack application with an open scope to create a RESTful site within a week. The website ended up being a social exercising platform which encourages people to compete and upload the best running traces theyâ€™ve saved on the social exercise app, Strava. I combined map data received from the Strava API and with the Google Maps API to give a visual representation of run activities.The website included the ability to rate and comment on submitted runs. This project was a brilliant opportunity to incorporate smaller features learnt through the course, such as having searching and filtering functionality on the main index page.</p>
